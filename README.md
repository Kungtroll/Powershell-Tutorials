# Powershell-Tutorials
Material I've created in order to teach Powershell to others.

In 2019 I started up a series of Powershell tutorial sessions in order to bring my team up to speed on powershell. I started out with some basics, with the assumption that they had some basic programming experience already. From there I moved on with object orientation and more powershell specific stuff, and as the class have moved on some student requests have been brought up as examples where we walked through a solution together. (It's become dead obvious to me that adding more brains to the problem will come up with several ways of solving it, sometimes in ways that are much smarter than what I had in mind from the start)

Unfortunately I wrote comments in a mix of Swedish and English, I might standardize that to English in the future.
