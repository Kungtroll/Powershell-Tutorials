I got a request on how to write to the top of a log-file 
instead of appending to the end of the file.

I googled it and found now other way of doing this
but to read all the content from the file and re-write
the file content to the file together with the new line.
I chose the solution where the new content (lines) is 
stored in an array as the first elements and the 
original file content is added as the next element in
the array. Then the whole array is written back to the 
file.

Try solving this yourself, and take a peek at my cmdlet
if you get stuck. Beware of how powershell auto-assing
the type for a variable, a single line may become a
string object while several lines will become an array 
of string objects, depending on what you put in you may
get unexpected results if you don't manage the type 
assignment yourself. The cmdlet was produced in a hurry, so
bugs are likely to be included.
